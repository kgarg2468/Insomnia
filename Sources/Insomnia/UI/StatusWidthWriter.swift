/// Control Center re-lays out the whole menu bar on every change of a status
/// item's length, and the app's next Core Animation commit waits for that
/// relayout: 8 ms on a good pass, 30-40 ms on a bad one, over 100 ms at a
/// session end (measured; see the design spec, revision 4). Driving the
/// length per frame therefore stalls the main thread on every frame, and
/// no pacing or frame-rate request changes that. So the length is written
/// exactly once per layout change, as Apple's own items do, and everything
/// that moves does so inside the item's window: the content is laid out at
/// its final width and its pills, countdown and mark animate in place.
///
/// A repeat of the current width is not written again.
